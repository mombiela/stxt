Document (dev.stxt.namespace):STXT - Built for humans. Reliable for machines.
	Header: @STXT@: Introduction 

	Alert>>
		@STXT@ has a **Human-First** spirit, putting people at the center. \\
		The documents are readable and expressive, while also being reliable for machines.
		
	Subheader: Documents
	
	Content>>
		An @STXT@ document is a structured text file, designed to be human-readable and easy for machines to process.
		It contains "nodes": non-empty lines (outside of `>>` blocks) that define "Name" and value pairs, or blocks of literal text.
		
	Subheader: Main features
		
	Content>>
		* Inline/container nodes: `Name: Value` (can have indented children).
		* Text blocks: `Name >>` followed by literal lines that are not parsed internally.
		* Hierarchy is defined by indentation (tabs or 4 spaces per level depending on the document).
		* Supports namespaces (e.g. `(@com.example)`), comments outside blocks (`# ...`), and validation via schemas (`@stxt.schema`).
		
		An STXT document balances human clarity with explicit semantic structure — ideal for content, configurations, and interoperable data.
