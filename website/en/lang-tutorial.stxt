	SubHeader: What is @STXT@?

	Content>>
		@STXT@ is a semantic and readable textual language, designed to represent
		structured documents in a simple and machine-processable way. Its basic rules
		allow inline nodes, literal text blocks, and namespaces.

	SubHeader: Example: book record for publishers

	Content>>
		Below we show a practical and simple example to describe a book

	SubHeader: Best practices

	Content>>
		- Use `>>` blocks for chapter content or multiline texts.
		- Keep indentation consistent (4 spaces per level) and do not mix tabs and spaces.
		- Use namespaces to separate schemas by publishers or collections.
		- Define minimum cardinalities in schemas to guarantee key data.

		to process automatically, (b) a converter to a catalog format
		(ISBN/OPDS) or (c) validation tests against the example schema. Which do you prefer?
