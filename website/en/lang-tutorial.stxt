	Subheader: 1. What is @STXT@?
	
	Content >>
		**@STXT@ (Semantic Text)** is a hierarchical and semantic textual language,
		designed to be **Human-First**:
		
		* Easy to read and write by people.
		* Trivial to parse by machines.
		* Secure by design.
		
		STXT allows representing structured documents through:
		
		* **Inline nodes** (`:`) for simple values.
		* **Literal text blocks** (`>>`) for multiline content.
		* **Indentation** to express hierarchy.
		* **Namespaces** to separate semantics and allow external validation.
		
		The base syntax is minimal. Advanced semantics are added through:
		
		* `@stxt.schema` — formal and exhaustive validation.
		* `@stxt.template` — simplified and prototype-oriented validation.
		
	Subheader: 2. Basic example: a book record
	
	Content >>
		Let’s look at a simple example of an STXT document that describes a book.
		There is no validation yet: it is only STXT core.

						Protocols, messaging, and integration patterns are described.
						
	Content >>
		Observations:
		
		* The hierarchy is defined **only by indentation**.
		* `Summary >>` and `Content >>` are literal text blocks: their content is not interpreted as STXT.
		* There is no implicit typing: everything is text unless validated.
		
	Subheader: 3. Using namespaces
	
	Content >>
		To be able to semantically validate a document, it is associated with a **namespace**.
		
		The namespace identifies which external rules (schema or template) can be applied.

	Content >>
		Key rules:
		
		* The namespace is inherited by child nodes.
		* A node can redefine its namespace if necessary.
		* STXT core **does not validate** the namespace: it only propagates it.
		
	Subheader: 4. Validation with Templates
	
	Content >>
		**Templates** allow defining structural and type rules
		in a compact way. They are ideal for prototypes and living documentation.
		
		A template is an STXT document whose namespace is `@stxt.template`.
		
	Subsubheader: 4.1 Template for books
	
	Code >>
		Template (@stxt.template): com.acme.book
			Description: Template for publishing book records
			Structure >>
				Book:
					Title: (1)
					Authors: (1)
						Author: (+)
					ISBN: (1)
					Publisher: (?)
					Published: (?) DATE
					Summary: (?) TEXT
					Chapters: (?)
						Chapter: (+)
							Number: (1) INTEGER
							Title: (1)
							Pages: (?) INTEGER
							Content: (?) TEXT
							
	Content >>
		What this template defines:
		
		* `Book` is the expected root node.
		* `Title` and `ISBN` are required (`(1)`).
		* `Author` can repeat (`(+)`).
		* `Published` must have `DATE` format.
		* `Summary` and `Content` are text blocks (`TEXT`).
		
	Subsubheader: 4.2 Applying the template
	
	Content >>
		A validator that supports templates can:
		
		* Verify that the nodes exist.
		* Check cardinalities.
		* Validate basic types (number, date, boolean, text).
		
		STXT core **does not change**: the template is applied over the already-parsed tree.
		
	Subheader: 5. Validation with Schemas
	
	Content >>
		**Schemas** provide the same information as a template,
		but in a more explicit and formal way.
		
		A schema:
		
		* Is an STXT document with namespace `@stxt.schema`.
		* Defines nodes, types, and cardinalities separately.
		* Is the “canonical” representation of validation.

	Content confirms >>
		* The schema is more verbose, but unambiguous.
		* A template can be automatically compiled into this form.
		* A validator **SHOULD** prioritize schema over template if both exist.

		This document:
		
		* Is valid STXT.
		* Complies with the `com.acme.book` template.
		* Complies with the `com.acme.book` schema.
		
	Subheader: 7. Best practices
	
	Content >>
		* Use `>>` blocks for long or literal text.
		* Keep indentation consistent (4 spaces per level).
		* Use templates to iterate quickly.
		* Use schemas when you need strict contracts.
		* Don’t mix semantics into the core: let schemas/templates do that work.
		
	Subheader: 8. Next steps
	
	Content >>
		From here it is common to:
		
		* Convert STXT to an intermediate model (node tree).
		* Transform to JSON, XML, YAML, or other formats.
		* Use STXT as a configuration, documentation, or secure exchange format.
